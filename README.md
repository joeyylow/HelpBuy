# HelpBuy
Help Buy is a mobile application which aims to target NUS staff and students living on campus to conveniently purchase items from elsewhere, or to be able to help buy goods for others when they are out. We hope to create a network that fulfils the needs of buyers at the deliverer’s convenience.

4. Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.
5. Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number seven times.
6. Return to the previous screen, scroll to the bottom, and tap Developer options.

8. On the computer, click on the “play” icon at the top right hand side in Android Studio to launch the application.
